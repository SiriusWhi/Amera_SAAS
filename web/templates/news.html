                <hr />
                <p id="news08">The <strong>Internet of Things</strong> is getting mainstream enough
                    that we need new acronyms to differentiate medical (IoMT) and industrial (IIoT) connected devices from consumer
                    doorbells, security cameras, weather stations, tennis rackets and <strong>nappies</strong> that are already
                    streaming data. IDC estimated some $200 billion was spent on Industrial IoT modules and sensors in 2019 as we move
                    towards the grand vision of Industry 4.0.
                </p>
                <p id="news009">The idea is that we're now onto the fourth industrial revolution
                    (steam power and electricity having given way to computers for the third industrial revolution). And part of this
                    grand vision is that smart, connected, machine learning-powered machinery that can configure, monitor, improve and
                    diagnose itself becomes part of everything from the factory floor to cars and cities.
                </p>
                <p id="news010">If you want to
                    pull back from talking about the future of everything to just the manufacturing and production bits, that's Industry
                    4.0. Then there's edge computing; having moved a lot of compute from the server room up to the cloud, we can now
                    push the most time-sensitive computation next to the machinery, falling back to the cloud for the analytics and
                    modelling that makes that local compute so targeted.
                </p>
                <p id="news011">Whatever we end up calling it, when IoT devices are
                    controlling drug pumps, manufacturing operations, fleet management and the <strong>electrical grid</strong>, you
                    <strong>want them to be secure</strong>.
                </p>
                <p id="news012">A firewall won't help with that. in the first half of 2018 Kaspersky
                    IoT honeypots detected 12 million attacks aimed at IoT devices coming from 69.000 IP addresses. In the first half of
                    2019 that was up to 105 million attacks from 276,000 unique IP addresses. Are you planning to block all the
                    malicious IP addresses?
                </p>
                <p id="news013">A perimeter firewall hasn't made sense as the way to protect devices since modems and
                    then smartphones made working outside the office common, just as walled castles are a bit out of date. Remote
                    connection policies are an attempt to force everyone to go over the drawbridge where you can take a look at them and
                    their identity papers. Conditional access policies are like putting someone very experienced on the gate: even if
                    the identify papers are stolen or a good forgery, they look for suspicious behaviour like having got here impossibly
                    fast or never having been here before but asking to go straight to the room in the tower with the treasure
                    in.
                </p>
                <p id="news014">And once you're inside the walls, you need to enforce access policies on every system with another
                    drawbridge into every room, because the firewall can only check 'north-south' traffic coming in from outside, not
                    'east-west' traffic bouncing around inside the network.
                </p>
                <p id="news015">Tempered Networks has what it calls a virtual air gap
                    firewall, which replaces the IP address with a cryptographic identity stored in secure hardware. That's one of many
                    approaches to IoT security. G+D (the company responsible for a large proportion of SIMs) suggests using eSIMs for
                    identity. Cisco Edge Intelligence promises anomaly detection – spotting compromised IoT devices by analysing network
                    traffic. Microsoft has Azure IoT services that use Azure Active Directory for identity and device management
                    (including updating devices, something that rarely happens today, using the Windows Update content distribution
                    network). It also has Azure Sphere, a hardware platform for building devices with a custom Linux distro and a secure
                    microcontroller unit that's been picked up by Qualcomm, NXP and other hardware suppliers.
                </p>
                <p id="news016">Arm – whose
                    embedded processors are widely used in IoT devices – is adding a hardware root of trust to chips used in IoT
                    devices, which can do things like blocking debugger access once a device has been deployed; this kind of lifecycle
                    protection is a good way to give developers powerful tools for building systems that hackers can't use to break into
                    them.
                </p>
                <p id="news017">There are also some simpler precautions you can take for IoT hardware
                    designed before these protections: making sure devices are never installed with the default password and using
                    strong identities for each IoT device, so it can only communicate with systems it's controlling or sending data to.
                    IoT devices are sometimes attacked as a way into your network, so limiting privileged admin accounts and moving from
                    basic authentication and passwords to MFA and biometrics or hardware tokens.
                </p>
                <p id="news018">Just remember that the reason
                    the S in IoT stands for 'security' is that you might have to put it there yourself. Or as Microsoft Distinguished
                    Engineer Galen Hunt put it when telling us about Azure Sphere in 2018, "there's been just enough IoT that people
                    have begun to realise how bad it could be."</p>

                <p id="news023">Proposed laws from the UK for Internet of Things security mean vendors will need to follow new rules to be considered
                secure.
                </p>
                <p id="news024">All <strong>Internet of Things and consumer smart devices</strong> will need to adhere to specific
                security requirements, under new government proposals.
                </p>
                <p id="news025">The aim of the legislation is to help protect UK citizens
                and businesses <strong>from the threats posed by cyber criminals increasingly targeting Internet of Things</strong>
                devices.
                </p>
                <p id="news026">By hacking IoT devices, cyber criminals can build an army of devices that can be <strong>used to conduct
                DDoS attacks to take down online services</strong>, while poorly-secured IoT devices can also serve as an easy way
                for hackers to get into networks and other systems across a network.
                </p>
                <p id="news027">The proposed measures from the Department
                for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have been developed in conjunction with the UK's National Cyber Security Centre

                <p id="news030">They also follow on from the previously suggested voluntary best practice requirements, but the legislation would
                require that IoT devices sold in the UK must follow three particular rules to be allowed to sell products in the UK.
                They are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p id="news031">All consumer internet-connected device passwords must be unique and not resettable to any universal factory
                            setting</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p id="news032">Manufacturers of consumer IoT devices must provide a public point of contact so anyone can report a vulnerability
                            and it will be acted on in a timely manner</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p id="news033">Manufacturers of consumer IoT devices must explicitly state the minimum length of time that the device will
                            receive security updates at the point of sale, either in store or online</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p id="news034">It is currently unclear how these rules will be enforced under any future law. While the government has said that its
                "ambition" is to introduce legislation in this area, and said this would be done "as soon as possible", there is no
                detail on when this would take place. A DCMS spokesperson told ZDNet that the department will be working with retailers
                and manufacturers as the proposals move forward.</p>
                <p id="news035">Many connected devices are shipped with simple, <strong>default
                    passwords</strong> that in many cases can't be changed, while some IoT product manufacturers often lack a means of
                being contacted to report vulnerabilities – especially if that device is produced on the other side of the
                world.</p>
                <p id="news036">In addition to this, it's been known for IoT products to suddenly stop receiving support from
                manufacturers, and providing an exact length of time that devices will be supported will allow users to think about how
                secure the product will be in the long term.</p>
                <p id="news037">If products don't follow these rules, the new law proposes that
                these devices could potentially be banned from sale in the UK.</p>
                <p id="news038">"Whilst the UK Government has previously
                encouraged industry <strong>to adopt a voluntary approach</strong>, it is now clear that decisive action is needed to
                ensure that strong cybersecurity is built into these products by design," said Warman.</p>
                <p id="news039">"Our new law will hold
                firms manufacturing and selling internet-connected devices to account and stop hackers threatening people's privacy and
                safety. It will mean robust security standards are built in from the design stage and not bolted on as an afterthought,"
                he added.</p>
                <p id="news040">"Smart technology is increasingly central to the way we live our lives, so the development of this
                legislation to ensure that we are better protected is hugely welcomed," said Nicola Hudson, policy and communications
                director at the NCSC.</p>
                <p id="news041">"It will give shoppers increased peace of mind that the technology they are bringing into
                their homes is safe, and that issues such as pre-set passwords and sudden discontinuation of security updates are a
                thing of the past."</p>
                <p id="news042">The UK isn't alone in attempting to secure the Internet of Things -- ENISA, the European
                Union's cybersecurity agency, <strong>is also working</strong> <strong>towards</strong> <strong>legislation</strong> in
                this area, <strong>while the US government is also looking to regulate IoT in an effort to protect against
                cyberattacks.</strong></p>
